In particular - the TTS voice doesn't seem to read out notifications anymore - and I don't see an icon in the top bar which I'm sure I used to do.  I suspect that the service is starting / stopping a lot - as I often see popup notifications telling me that the service has started - which I think I'd only expect to normally see when I first boot the phone. If I can help to debug these issues somehow - I'd be grateful to help! Edit - this could just be me not setting the Apps for Accessibility up properly!,Accessibility Review

I didn't set a bg color on my body and every other browser displays white but this one prefers the gray side. Sometimes major sites like Google and others will show as having a gray bg color as well.

It's confusing to tell if I'm on incognito or not as both the dark theme and incognito have the same color scheme. 3) Put a lock in the search box when you're on a HTTPS site - or a lack thereof when you're not.

Then there is an option to block ads - set any user agent - activate text reflow and change the text size of any web page.

First of all let me thank you for the continued support of the Alarm Klock application. I've been happily using it for many years. However - I'm very unhappy about the new UI. Everything is more complicated now.  Consider changing the time of the alarm (which is something I do often): previously you clicked the alarm and you could start changing the time. Now you have to long-click the alarm - then click the time - an only then you can change it. Why make it more complicated? What's the purpose?  Other problems: - maximum volume-increase interval is now 60 seconds. In the old app I used 90 seconds and I was happy about it. Why did this had to be disabled? What's so wrong about 90 seconds? - the ""increase/decrease by 1 minute"" buttons are missing. You now have to fiddle with the system keyboard to achieve this. Inconvenient. - icons are used instead of texts. App looks ""cooler"" but it's harder to determine which option does what. Again - inconvenient.  I use Android Marshmallow and the old UI worked perfectly for me. The new UI adds nothing - removes some functionality and makes other functionality harder to use.

That was okay for MP3s - because I could turn down the volume to 1% (yes - literally) - which at that point was only a little bit too loud. But my MP3s change often - and if I forget to update AK to a new song - which happened a lot - then it would default to its incredibly annoying default sound - and play it at a thousand times the volume I desire. Unable to get it to wake me up at a reasonable volume - day after day - I have stopped using AK.  Some people might need volume equal to a launching space shuttle in order to wake up - and for those people AK will probably be awesome.

Instead - each Note has to be saved individually as a text file in a directory folder you choose. Just click the Save icon - which appears only when you enter to read that particular note. As at Oct 2017 - it is not possible to save numerous texts in one go by highlighting.... After the texts are saved - you can share the entire directory to cloud/card for safekeeping. However importing is easier - you dont need to handle the Notes filed one by one. The settings button has an Import function - you can highlight several text files at one go to import. Although quite troublesome - the advantages of this app is the clean interface - the ability to choose font size and hence line spacing - and an option to auto edit directly. And no annoying ads - no need to pay. I dumped 20 other notepad apps to keep this one - and could accept the primitive backup system.,Accessibility Review

One minor issue: I'm not sure whether this is a bug or something that TalkBack doesn't read properly - but I've noticed it is not possible to create a new game.,Accessibility Review

When this happens I take out my headphones and run one of the programs. The app works extremely well and the option of adjusting the volume of the binaural beat and of the background pink noise is wonderful. I confess I sometimes just use pink noise because a little with closed headphones really gets you isolated and into a book - but I mostly use the Study and learning program. At home I have experienced lucid dreaming a couple of times - it does work. The highest mental activity is great when you are a bit down or depressed.

This looked promising... until I really used it. The real problem is the text editing window. Its more or less unusable on a 720p phone screen. Only about 3 lines of text - about 1/6th of the screen - are visible while editing. When trying to do tasks such as selecting text that is more than said 3 lines the screen scrolls nearly out of control. This limited view is entirely due to interface choices made by the developer rather than my screen size. There are all kinds of additional input boxes - tag - fields - and headers visable when simply trying to edit text. It feels like the developer never actually tried to take a note in their own app. On top of that the app uses a markdown style formatting so you can only see the formatting when you preview the note or are not editing it. I don't view notes unless I'm editing them so markdown formatting is useless. Actually - less than useless because markdown formatting makes things HARDER to read. A number of these note apps use markdown like this and it is frustrating.,Accessibility Review

I wish we could use canned msgs here. These two - I would give 5 stars and wouldn't mind paying!  Edit: Adding one more star for the prompt support and for getting confirmation that I can use canned msgs. But the visual cue on phone is sort of a deal breaker for me. Can I fix it with root?

I would really like to see someone work on a native app to replace it. It's not so unresponsive as to be impractical - but just slow enough to be occasionally annoying (on a Nexus 5).  One specific beef I have is with the emoji. The interface for inserting emoji is the same type-colon-to-see-context-menu approach - which is extremely unwieldy on a smartphone where depending on the input method used - the colon is a lower priority character and is often buried several clicks away. Emoji on smartphones need to be much more accessible. The whole point of emoji is to alleviate text entry through the cumbersome smartphone interface - not exacerbate it. So whoever implements a native Mattermost app - I hope they just copy the standard one-click emoji menu used by every other chat client on the planet  -)  This is true for all Mattermost clients though. The system still pretty much requires you to know the text name of an emoji to find it - which is a weakness with the program. Certainly not game breaking - but an annoyance.,Accessibility Review

GNU/Linux CLI in the palm of your hand --with the apt package-manager to boot! (It's a custom repo - but it has a pretty good selection - nonetheless. (The only thing I'm really missing is PDFGREP - and I bet there's a simple way to get it that I am overlooking.))   UPDATE: WARNING: DON'T TRY THIS! DISCLAIMER: I KNOW NOTHING!  I *was* overlooking something. I ended up using wget to download the source files for pdfgrep - uncompressed the tarball - cd'd into the newly created directory - ran: [grep /bin/sh *] - changed all instances of ""/bin/sh"" to ""/data/data/com.termux/files/bin/sh"" -then ran [./configure] and then [make]. I didn't ""make install"" - I just cp'd pdfgrep to /data/data/com.termux/files/bin/  THEN cp'd the pdfgrep.1 file in the /doc directory (which was inside my pdfgrep directory (which was created during this build)) into the man1 dir via: [cp doc/pdfgrep.1 /data/data/com.termux/files/man/man1/] Now I can execute pdfgrep - and I can enter ""man pdfgrep"" and it all works (and searches the contents of the PDF files on my sd card). Then I removed the tarball and the build directory.  Oh - and my phone is NOT ROOTED - by the way - and that hasn't kept from me from doing anything yet.  You can get Termux-API to add a few more features - like the ability to send and read SMS messages from the command line. You can also import your contacts - and more neat stuff.  You get access to your SD card (after enter a short command one time).  I was using (or attempting to use) one of the other most popular terminal emulators - but it was less than bare-bones - with no package manager... Needless to say - I was thrilled to discover this one.  The controls are easy to adapt to within a day or two. (Volume up or down gives you your CTRL and/or ALT action.)  I love running my scripts on my phone - and you just use [ termux-fix-shebang  ] to make it executable in the app. (The directory path in Termux is a little longer than just /bin/bash - it's /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin.)  I've even got $(apt list) and $(apt show) piping into dialog then into $(apt install) for a quasi-GUI type package manager setup deal. (It's dirty - but it gives me a selection box with descriptions.)  Anyways - I could ramble on and on...  I tried quite a few other options to have GNU/Linux in my Samsung Galaxy 6 - but nothing compares to this.  So - get this app if you love BASH! (or dash or zsh or fish ...-- with aptitude installed - you get choices!!!)",Accessibility Review

And - if I'm at someone else's computer and need access to my stuff - I can just ssh into my phone and enjoy the convenience of big screen/keyboard/mouse with my portable server! :-)  Yeah - it's slower than a desktop - but surprisingly usable.  Before this - I had thought seriously about loading ubuntu onto my tablet to get this type of portable linux environment - but honestly - termux gives me pretty much everything I need (console-based for now) - plus android .. best of both worlds!  Just when I'm already blown away - I find other really stuff in the well-written docs: multiple-sessions - keyboard enhancements (such as: press volume down to simulator ctrl) -  termux-api (send/read SMS - text-to-speech etc.) ... just incredible.

The app looks suitable for what I was looking for except for that little detail.   This has two bad consequences - the first (obvious) one is that your phone may decide it knows better than yourself the password you are typing - and substitute it.  The second (much more dangerous) consequence is that - once you have written that password - your keyboard will remember it. After this - ANYONE using your phone may discover it easily - for example by simply start typing in Google with the same first letters of your password and then having a look at your keyboard's suggestions.  I have some experience with Android - so I know that it is relatively easy to change the input type of a text field so that it knows it is intended for passwords. With that detail solved - the app would be ideal.,Accessibility Review

There's also the Download section. It has everything that is downloading - has been downloaded - and if it hasn't been - hell yeah - it actually tells you why.  As far as I can tell it's not eating my data (while saying that it's not) which is always a good thing. It has a dark theme (everything should have a dark theme).  And - since it has the iTunes database - I can find stuff that I wasn't able to find on Stitcher.  As I said - perhaps my opinion will change? But - as of using it right now - I love it.

Let the user search for a name pattern in the huge list - or let the user filter out anything except SqlLite files.  I can't comment on the data editing yet - but I'll pass on the same comments:  Larger font for larger devices - easy editing - and maybe a search or search/replace feature.",Accessibility Review

But for development it lacks many features. The top most are: In table list there should be a number of records next to table name! In data view the row should be highlighted if I press my finger on the screen and trigger edit on long press. Or simply zoom the dataview (temporarily - I don't want to change font size to 25). Why? Because edit is a small target - with no hint I keep hitting one row up or down from my target. I also found a small bug: Open recent database doesn't work for databases needing root - it says can't find db.,Accessibility Review

It would be much more intuitive to have a coloured circle next to the contact's names in the roster to indicate their status.  Also - I got this app from F-droid for free. It doesn't seem logical to me for the app to be free on one app store and paid on another... Especially since this is open source software. It's a pain to have to get my friends to download and install F-droid to be able to use the best XMPP client - although it's not that bad.  There aren't many theming options. Although it is nice to have a dark theme - it would be even better to be able to customise the main colour of the app - like Xabber. Options for different shaped message bubbles would also be welcome.   Apart from these small problems - in my opinion this is a well designed - intuitive app that is perfect for chatting over XMPP.

This is a solid effort that's really well put together for something that's free and open source!  There's more information that you can shake a stick at - and plenty of customization (although it can always use more - like adjustable delays between animated frames - and things like that.)    The only issues I have with it are the national radar map graphic is squished and can't be zoomed - so it's almost impossible to select radars from that particular image. (Radars can be selected by long-pressing on the actual radar window itself - though which is even more handy!)  The other issue is that city/town names on the edge of the display tend to get all bunched up and unreadable.  Animation is slow or doesn't render correctly on L2 data - but I see the author has offered a possible solution to that - so I'll update this if it fixes my problem there.    So - that's it.

The foremost issue is that oftentimes some information won't get saved - such as the character's names - or its two top aspects - for example.   That aside - other features to focus on moving forward are of course the ability to sync this app with other devices - since this is at its heart an informational reference app. Another important emphasis looks like it will be in expanding data types. What this refers to is things like adding descriptions to each aspect to elaborate upon - usually done to suggest a few ideas for invokes and compels. Stunts might want to be set up in a similar fashion - such that their names can collapse what could often be elaborate descriptions as to what they do. Stress uses up a lot more vertical space than it really needs to - and it would probably be for the best to enable the user to create new stress tracks for more modded games.   Minor details probably include things like being able to label consequence slots with letters to differentiate the specialized physical or mental stress consequences one gains at +5 in the respective skill. Another useful idea might be to create groups underneath a header. For example - on the main Fate Sheets screen - a user may want to organize their characters by genre - or by PCs versus mooks. Users might also find use in organizing aspects or stunts in this manner. It couldn't hurt to future-proof - and it's possible to accomplish these things without cluttering up the screen too much.,Accessibility Review

For starters - the comments section is a bit confusing (it's messy because it lacks visual hierarchy) - and it could use some reworking: there should be a better distinction between a comment's header (the part where the commenter's username and flair - and the comment's score are displayed) and the comment's body - Roboto Light should be available for the comments section as well. I also think comment indentation could be a little bigger to emphasize you're going to a deeper level.  On the subreddit view - there should be a maximum size for the thumbnail when the big picture mode is on - so large images don't take up as much screen space. The cards could also be a little tweaked to become more organized - and reduce the overcrowding of information around the title of the post. It would be nice if there was some form of indication so we could know - beforehand - what type of link are we clicking on when big picture mode is NOT activated â€” is it an image? Gif? Video?  Lastly - search should be more accessible (it could replace the multi-column icon on the action bar) - because it's something people do a lot. Also - it should be possible to change the search terms or the subreddit one is searching in without having to go back to the homepage and tap Search again.  Despite all this - Slide is the best Reddit app in the Play Store right now - it just needs a couple of improvements to be the perfect one.,Accessibility Review

The faded desktop wallpaper is the persistent state - and restored wallpaper lasts a few seconds - with the timer resetting if you touch the screen (so you can look at the restored wallpaper as long as you like).  Finally - you don't have to use their daily art as your wallpaper and can instead use your own images.  I use a folder of wallpapers I've collected and have them change hourly.

There is for one the city specification which may not OsmAnd's issue at all. In my area streets were defined to a totally different city. Also searches are resulting in different choice but don't indicate what house number are hidden behind the results making it a lucky guess to where to drive and arrive. I tried several navigation apps and it is a pretty good feature pack - but i think its needs more work to make it more accessible. This is my verdict so far.

Another bug which is annoying is that sometimes the voice navigation crashes or something and map is still showing correctly but when for example it wants to speak that I need to turn left - instead it only lowers volume on background music and it does not restore it back!  In both cases the app needs to be restarted and after this it starts working correctly. I think that these problems are caused when I try to search some longer bicycle route and when after 10 minutes is still searching I will stop it.

Some are so miminal that they're no better than the web interface - others are so poorly designed you'd be better off hitting yourself in the face with your phone (which some Reddit comments will make you do anyhow - so you may as well get started early). RedReader is finally the first reader that has a simple - clean design with a perfect balance of features.   A killer feature for me is the ability to force my Nexus 7 into ""tablet mode"" so I'm not stuck looking at a stretched out phone layout. The only missing feature here is the ability to adjust the font size (and hopefully stretch the thumbnail responsively).

Sharing both ways works w/ MPE Notes and this is good for MPE sync'ing (even if indirectly).

It's harsh on the eyes - but obviously - this is just a cosmetic problem. Also cosmetic is the fact that the zoom controls are kinda off - as in they are compressed-skewed. This might be a UI problem related to phone display aspect ratio and resolutions.  Choosing faces works fine - but when saving the image - it saves the image at a much lower resolution (this cannot be chosen). So I'm editing a 5M image - and it re-saves it to below VGA resolution. Sometimes - the pixellation or redaction are also slightly off-centered from the actual selection area. The video is also slow to process - but this might have to do with the phone processing power limitation (not the fault of developers). I'm assuming that not only does it individually process each frame - but it must be re-compressed and packed into a container file.,Accessibility Review

Double tap to zoom to 100% is very useful. I'll try to user it as default app - very promising. There are several issues that I've noticed from the start: 1. If I open some image - hide this app - go to home screen - and open this app again - it will start from it's albums view instead of displaying the same picture on which I left off. Very annoying. UPD.: Cannot reproduce it anymore. Strange:) 2. If I delete some picture - app will return to folder view but deleted picture thumbnail is still displaying. It goes away only after closing and opening this folder again. 3. Can't change sort direction (ascending - descending). I'm used to sort by name in descending direction - but app sorts only in ascending direction. There is a bit of a mess with timestamps - timezones - etc. - so names is quite useful for sorting. Also - I can't set different sort mode for different for different folders. 4. Current date or name is not showing while doing a quick scroll with scroll bar. It can make navigation much easier in folder with many photos. 5. Animation feels a bit slow (long duration). It's just my opinion.  Hope most of these will be fixed while app will be evolving,Accessibility Review
